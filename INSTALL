How to Compile and Install GD4O
===============================

Version 1.0a5, November 24, 2003


The following instructions are for installation with Findlib. In case
you prefer not to use Findlib, I have included the old Makefile as
'Makefile.orig'; it may work with little or no change.

Prerequisites
-------------
 * Version numbers are those used in development. Earlier versions *
 * have not been tested, and may or may not work. *

OCaml 3.06/3.07
  <http://caml.inria.fr/>
Findlib 0.8.1/0.9
  <http://www.ocaml-programming.de/packages/>
GD 2.0.15
  <http://www.boutell.com/gd/>

OS: Linux (developed on Debian GNU/Linux 3.0); may work on other POSIX
  systems. I hope to make the package portable to Windows in the future.


Compiling and installing
------------------------

If you have properly installed the required packages, installation
should be very easy.

Edit the Makefile to reflect your configuration, then run.

  make all
  make opt  # optional, but highly recommended
  make test
    -OR-
  make test.opt
    -(assuming the test was successful)
  make install

Running the test suite--"make test"--is strongly recommended. See "Test
script" below for more information.

You may also wish to

  make docs

which will generate OCaml API docs in the doc/ subdirectory.


Test script
-----------

This package includes a test script that exercises most functions of the
API in at least rudimentary fashion. You can run the script with the
command 'make test'.

At the risk of stating the obvious: the powers of automated testing are
very limited when applied to a graphics package of this kind. A
successful test result means simply that the test was completed with no
exceptions; there is no guarantee that the output is correct. 

Therefore, to be sure that GD4O will produce the desired results, you
should at least visually inspect all files produced by the test routine.
