GD4O - known bugs as of Aug. 21, 2003
=====================================

* Antialiased drawing is dreadfully slow.

* Antialiased lines of width > 1 appear as several overlapping lines rather
  than a single wide line (may be a bug in GD itself).

* When attempting to dump several images to an out_channel, the last one
  is not written.
