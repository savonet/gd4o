What is GD4O?
-------------

GD4O is an OCaml interface to the GD graphics library. It is based on
OCamlGD 0.7, developed by Shawn Wagner. Since that package is not
actively maintained at present--and, to the best of my knowledge, its
author does not intend to continue working on it--I decided to take up
development. 

The goal of this project is to provide a complete and up-to-date
interface to GD. The current version is very incomplete, but may be
usable for very simple graphics.


Major changes from OCamlGD
--------------------------

 * GD4O uses Findlib

 * New drawing objects:
  
     polygon
     filled_polygon
     filled_ellipse

 * Implemented antialiased drawing

 * Truecolor images

 * TrueType fonts

 * Created more extensive test program, which draws most available
   shapes and tests all output methods.
